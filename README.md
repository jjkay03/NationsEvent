# NATIONS EVENT PLUGIN
This plugin is designed for Nations Events, offering a comprehensive suite of features to streamline event management. It provides moderation tools, event host utilities, and a variety of essential commands. Additionally, depending on the plugin version or branch, it introduces unique, game-altering mechanics tailored to specific events.

In Nations Events most of the time death is permanent and all players only have one live, for this feature we use an other one of my plaugins [NationsDeathBan](https://github.com/jjkay03/NationsDeathBan) in combination with this one.
